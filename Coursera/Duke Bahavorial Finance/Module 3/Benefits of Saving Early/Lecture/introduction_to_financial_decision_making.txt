We've completed our examination of
some of the more common biases and errors that lead us to make
sub-optimal decisions. What we like to do is look at financial
decision making by individuals, institutions and in fact,
even entire global markets. We'll try to identify which
biases can be used to explain a series of so-called paradoxes about
the way the financial markets behave. Things like bubbles and crashes, what are the behavioral
aspects that are driving those? We'll start with personal investing. And we'll look at some investing rules
that everybody really should adhere to, but a lot of us really don't. And then we're go on to
analyze why those rules are so often broken by using the lens
of behavioral finance to spot where the decision making
errors keep creeping in.

We're going to talk about
relative probabilities. Now you noticed last time out
we used in the mission bias we used a public health
discussion about vaccines. We use a lot of health
issues when we talk about the cost of decision making, because they
have such immense public and social costs. So that's one of the reasons
behavioral finance people focus so much on these large societal problems. Because at the end of the day, they cost a lot of money and it's coming
out of your pocket as a taxpayer. We're going to talk about
relative probability and we have another health problem and
I want you to focus on the case study. So we have a gentleman, Hugh, who sets out on his habitual
morning walk across the park. And he's pondered the troubling
information that he's read in the morning's newspaper
that over the counter painkillers, such as Ibuprofen,
can double the risk of a heart attack. Now the article noted that millions depend
on such drugs to relieve symptoms of arthritis, headaches, and
other common ailments. But now sufferers face a dilemma of
whether to continue taking some of the most commonly used painkillers after
they were found to carry similar risks to other drugs which have already been
withdrawn, which is what the article said. Now, suppose that Hugh is 70 years old,
he's in pain. He has rheumatoid arthritis and
that depends on his daily dose of ibuprofen to manage pain in his joints
so he can get around and walk in the park. Suppose that he also has a family history
of heart disease with both his father and his older brother dying from
heart attacks in their late 70s. How concerned should he be about
the article in the morning newspaper? Is there critical additional information
he should obtain before deciding whether to quit taking Ibuprofen for
joint pain?

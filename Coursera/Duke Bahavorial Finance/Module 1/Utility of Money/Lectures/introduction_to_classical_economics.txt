Welcome to the first week
of behavioral finance. Over the course of this entire course, you're going to see any number of
ways in which we behave irrationally. And we're going to see how to correct for
some of those errors. But if we're to understand irrationality, we need to start with kind of a definition
of what is rational behavior. Rational behavior is what has
been laid down over many decades by what we call classical economists,
mostly the economists who would have taught you your
introductory micro and macro classes. They're going with classical economics,
it's always the thing that we teach first. But once you've got a little bit of
a basis of that, it's kind of more fun to start looking at where people make
mistakes and behave irrationally. So this week we're going to go through
the intro, we're going to cover the basics of classical rational economics
just to give us a starting point. And then from next week onwards, we'll
start having fun with all the errors.

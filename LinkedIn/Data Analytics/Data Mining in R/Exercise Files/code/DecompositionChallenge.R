# INSTALL AND LOAD PACKAGES ################################

# Install pacman if you don't have it (uncomment next line)
# install.packages("pacman")

# Install and/or load packages with pacman
pacman::p_load(  # Use p_load function from pacman
  changepoint,   # Changepoint analysis
  datasets,      # R's built-in sample datasets
  magrittr,      # Pipes
  pacman,        # Load/unload packages
  rio,           # Import/export data
  tidyverse      # So many reasons
)

# LOAD AND PREPARE DATA ####################################

# Use `EuStockMarkets` data from R's `datasets` package.
# This data gives the daily closing prices of major European
# stock indices: Germany's DAX (Ibis), Switzerland's SMI,
# France's CAC, and the UK's FTSE.

# Get info on the dataset
?EuStockMarkets

# See the data (with decimal dates)
EuStockMarkets

# Plot the data
EuStockMarkets %>% plot()

# Decomposition is easiest with just one time series, so
# we'll focus on France's CAC ("Cotation Assist√©e en
# Continu" or "continuous assisted trading"). We'll select
# that one time series and save it to `df`, which allows
# code to be reused
df <- EuStockMarkets[, 3]  # This selects the third series

# Plot the CAC data
df %>%
    plot(
    main = "French CAC Closing Prices, 1991-1998",
    xlab = "Year",
    ylab = "Closing Price",
    ylim = c(0, 5000)
  )

# CLEAN UP #################################################

# Clear data
rm(list = ls())  # Removes all objects from the environment

# Clear packages
detach("package:datasets", unload = T)  # For base packages
p_unload(all)    # Remove all contributed packages

# Clear plots
graphics.off()   # Clears plots, closes all graphics devices

# Clear console
cat("\014")      # Mimics ctrl+L

# Clear R
#   You may want to use Session > Restart R, as well, which 
#   resets changed options, relative paths, dependencies, 
#   and so on to let you start with a clean slate

# Clear mind :)
